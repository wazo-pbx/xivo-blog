Hi everyone, long time no see!

We've been quite busy the last few days, but we are pleased to announce the birth of a new project in the world of communications, introducing: [Wazo](http://www.wazo.community).


What is Wazo?
-------------

[Wazo](http://www.wazo.community) is a unified communication platform and a full-featured IPBX based on Asterisk, oriented towards enterprise communications. Wazo was forked from XiVO on November 25th, 2016, starting off the development version following XiVO 16.13. Every feature of XiVO 16.13 is still available in Wazo, and there are more to come...


Who are we?
-----------

The Wazo development team is led by Sylvain Boily (founder of XiVO in 2005) and working together on XiVO since 2010 in Québec City (Canada). This team is highly dedicated to develop and maintain its unique platform and share ideas with the community:

* Sylvain Boily
* Etienne Lessard
* Pascal Cadotte-Michaud
* Sébastien Duthil
* François Blackburn


What is our vision?
-------------------

We strongly believe that telephony should be available everywhere: on any device, in any application, in any software environment you have, so that you can call who you want, when you want. In order to achieve this, we want a telephony software that is easy to setup, easy to integrate with other software, scalable and extendable at will.

Free software is in our sense the only way to go in this direction because it ensures that users can adapt Wazo to their own specific situations where telephony is needed, and that they are free to choose who to ask for help. For this, the project needs a strong community and the most important part in this project is cooperation in the community: all the passionate people who use, install and modify Wazo should work together, exchange needs, feature requests, specifications, bug reports, patches and pull requests. Because that is in our sense the best way to improve software.

Be sure that Wazo will keep the spirit of XiVO:

* a totally free software, pure [GNU GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) project,
* stable release every 3 weeks,
* developers can answer your questions,
* and the most important, an incredible community on the [forums](http://projects.wazo.community/projects/xivo/boards), IRC (#wazo on Freenode) and [Github](https://github.com/wazo-pbx)


What's next?
------------

We intend to continue the work we have started a few years ago: make Wazo completely controllable through [REST APIs](http://api.wazo.community), which is one of the best way we know of to enable easy interconnection with other software systems. These APIs also allow people to develop graphical interfaces easily and we certainly intend to use those APIs to make graphical interfaces, like a more modern web interface or a mobile application. Moreover, APIs give more flexibility for creating distributed or centralised systems over multiple machines... Possibilities are vast and don't hesitate to share your own ideas: let's write together the future in telecommunications!


When is our next release due?
-----------------------------

We will release Wazo 16.16 very shortly, in the next few days. We will provide a simple procedure to upgrade your XiVO installation to Wazo, we want to keep the transition as smooth as possible. Keep in touch!
