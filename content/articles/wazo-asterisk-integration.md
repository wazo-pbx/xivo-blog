# Customizing your Asterisk configuration on Wazo

Wazo is a full featured IPBX using Asterisk. It has many functionnalities implemented
in its configuration interface and many API to configure your telephony system. But
sometime what you need is simply missing. This article will show some common ways to
modify your Wazo server to use features from Asterisk that are not available in the
wide range of Wazo tools.


## Dialplan

Dialplan is used to modify the flow of a call. The easiest way to add dialplan to
Wazo is through its web interface in the `Services -> IPBX -> Configuration files`
menu. The `xivo-extrafeatures` context is available to all users and can be used
to add new extensions to your dial plan. New contexts can also be added using the
[Asterisk dialplan](http://the-asterisk-book.com/1.6/dialplan-grundlagen.html)
syntax.

Extra dialplan files can be added in `/etc/asterisk/extensions_extra.d/`.


### The Wazo dialplan

The dialplan shipped with Wazo can be found in `/usr/share/xivo-config/dialplan/asterisk`
reading this dialplan may help find available options that can be tweaked using
subroutines and debug call flow problems.


### Subroutines

Most ressource on a Wazo can execute a dialplan subroutine before being reached.
This allow the administrator to add custom dialplan before calling the Asterisk
application.

For example:

With the following contexts in `xivo-extrafeatures.conf`

```ini
[aastra-autoanswer]
exten = s,1,SIPAddHeader(Alert-Info: info=alert-autoanswer)
same = n,Return()
```

If a user has the `aastra-autoanswer` subroutine, its phone will be automatically
answered when it starts ringing.

## Configuration files

Asterisk configuration files are in `/etc/asterisk`. Most configuration files are
generated by `xivo-confgend`. To view the generated output of a configuration file,
use the command that is in the configuration file.

For example, the content of `/etc/asterisk/sip.conf` is:

```ini
; autogenerated from xivo-confgend

#exec /usr/bin/xivo-confgen asterisk/sip.conf
```

To view the generated configuration file you can do the following command:

```sh
xivo-confgen asterisk/sip.conf
```

You can add or overwrite values to a section using the following syntax:

```ini
; autogenerated from xivo-confgend

#exec /usr/bin/xivo-confgen asterisk/sip.conf

[general](+)
accept_outofcall_message=yes
outofcall_message_context=astsms
```

This example adds or modify the options `accept_outofcall_message` and
`outofcall_message_context` in the `general` section of the `sip.conf` file.

Note that these changes will have to be redone at each upgrade modifying the
configuration file. The old version will be kept in a file with the same name
with .dpkg-old appended.

```sh
# ls sip.conf*
sip.conf  sip.conf.dpkg-old
```

Some configuration files also include another directory that should be used
when available.

manager.conf

```ini
[general]
enabled = yes
webenabled = yes
port = 5038
bindaddr = 0.0.0.0

#include manager.d/*
```

All files in `/etc/asterisk/manager.d/` will be read when reloading the
configuration and these files will not be modified during an upgrade.

If you do these kinds of customizations on your own. Make sure you sure the wazo
upgrade notes when upgrading to be able to make the appropriate changes when
necessary.
