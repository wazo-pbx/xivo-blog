Until now, the XiVO Client was released for only two different
platforms : Windows, Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu. Yes, that makes three,
but Ubuntu is based upon Debian, and the two versions do not differ.

However, the Qt framework that is used by the XiVO Client allows
applications to be also built for Mac OS. Furthermore, back in the 1.1
version, the XiVO Client was supported on Mac OS. We then reused the old
building script that were rotting in our Git repository and cleaned them
up to allow us to build a new Mac version of the XiVO Client.

Here's what it looks like :

The stable version will be released at the same time as other platforms,
by the end of the week, with the XiVO 1.2.5 release.

For hackers who would want to play around with the XiVO Client's source
code on Mac OS (or other platforms), the instructions for building and
coding can be found here :
http://documentation.xivo.io/dev/developers/xivo\_client/xivo\_client.html

Another big news, even though Archers are (unfortunately ;) ) a bit
fewer than Mac users, the XiVO Client package for Archlinux on the AUR
is also being restored, and will soon be available in the AUR. The two
packages already here have not been updated since last year.
