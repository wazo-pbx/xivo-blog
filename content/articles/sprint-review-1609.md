Hello XiVO community! Here comes the release of XiVO 16.09!

New features in this sprint
---------------------------

**Web interface**: Editing a user with many functions keys now takes the same time as editing a user with no function keys. There is a noticeable performance improvement when editing users with lots (25+) of function keys.

**Entities**: A new API has been added to manage entities on a XiVO. Entities allow administrators to isolate multiple companies or departments on the same XiVO server, so that they may share resources like the machine itself, or phone connections with operators.

**User call flow**: New APIs have also been added so that users may control their current call flow, like hanging up or transferring to a third party. The XiVO Client uses those APIs under the hood, and benefits from a couple of bugfixes brought by those APIs.

**Installation**: Older versions of XiVO may be installed via the installation script (only the older ISO images were available until now). This is especially useful for restoring old backups, or migrating XiVO across machines. Thank you to Gregory Esnaud from the XiVO community for contributing!

**Operators**: XiVO is now compatible with operators and devices offering SS7 signalling. This allows XiVO to be used with more diverse physical interconnections.


Technical features
------------------

**SCCP phones:** The newer Cisco SCCP firmwares 9.4 are available for installation.
