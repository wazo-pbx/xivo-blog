We were kindly invited to participate to the [Software Freedom
Day](http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/2011/Canada/Montreal/SFD-ETS) at
Montreal. It was a great day and we had the opportunity to speak about
[XiVo](http://wiki.xivo.io/).

Jean-Yves Lebleu talked about the software part, Nicolas Bouliane about
the hardware, and Nicolas Hicher the packaging. It was also an
opportunity to introduce the team.Thank you to MichaÃ«l Faille and Fabian
Rodriguez for the organization.
